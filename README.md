# LuxurySparse

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/QuantumBFS/LuxurySparse.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/QuantumBFS/LuxurySparse.jl)

This package contains

* General Permutation Matrix,
* Identity Matrix,

with high performance `type convertion`, `kron` and `multiplication` operations.

`LuxurySparse.jl` is still a part of [Yao.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl) (a quantum circuit simulation package).
Its document is maintained [here](https://quantumbfs.github.io/Yao.jl/latest/man/luxurysparse/).
It will be moved out from `Yao.jl` completely and start to accept PR soon.
