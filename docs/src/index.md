# LuxurySparse

*A "Luxury" sparse matrix library for julia language.*

[LuxurySparse](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/LuxurySparse.jl) is a Julia package from [QuantumBFS](https://github.com/QuantumBFS). It aims to provide powerful sparse matrix types for Julia, initially motivated by [Quantum Simulation](https://quantumbfs.github.io/Yao.jl/latest/).

It contains
* more sparse matrix types like `IMatrix`, `PermMatrix` and `SparseMatrixCOO`
* high performance type conversion, `kron`, and multiplication operations.
